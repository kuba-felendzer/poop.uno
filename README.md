# poop.uno

The source code for my website. I guess if you're intersted in how I did it and refuse to use inspector (I don't blame you), you can use this.

Please note I have not uploaded the `res/` folder, because it's full of like random junk and not really relevant to the function of the site. However, if you wanted to use the same framework that I did then you need to make your own res folder.
