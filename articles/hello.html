<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
    Click on an article in the sidebar to show it here. The links up above will take you to external sites.
    <br /><br />
    "The Ancient Texts" are old versions of the site, for anyone who is interested. These old versions aren't really maintained anymore, so stuff might be broken or missing.<br />
    "Source" is the source code for this website (on GitHub), whereas "GitHub" is just my GitHub page.<br/><br/>
