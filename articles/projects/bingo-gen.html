<h1>Bingo Generator</h1>

<h4>A bingo sheet generator</h4>

This is a python script that generates bingo sheets. It's a bit hacky, using mostly hard-coded values and guesswork to use it specifically for my base image. I'm going to work on a "visual configurator" so that it's high quality software (tm).

Here's an example of input:

And here's what it morphs to:

Overall just a simple excursion into PIL and the wonders of accepting every single minute project that comes your way because you're bored beyond belief.
