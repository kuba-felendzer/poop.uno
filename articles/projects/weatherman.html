<h1>Weatherman</h1>

<h4>A personal utility discord bot</h4>

This is a bot that I wrote so wouldn't have to keep sending screenshots of the weather in my personal servers.
It uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vierofernando/python-weather">python-weather</a> API by vierofernando, which is not the most accurate but it's very easy to use.
<br/><br/>
Along with telling you the weather, I also added an extra command that just spits out some text it picked from a list, and it can run polls.
<br/><br/>
This is called Weatherman, and was originally just a weather bot, but nowadays it's just whenever I need/want to add a discord bot feature to a personal server of mine, I add it to this.
<br/><br/>
Here's an example of what it does:
