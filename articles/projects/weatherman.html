<h4>A Discord bot that tells you the weather</h4>

This is a bot that I wrote so wouldn't have to keep sending screenshots of the weather in my personal servers.
It uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vierofernando/python-weather">python-weather</a> API by vierofernando, which is not the most accurate but it's very easy to use.
<br/><br/>
Along with telling you the weather, I also added an extra command that just spits out some text it picked from a list.
This was just to quell my boredom while I was on a school trip, mostly.
<br/><br/>
Here's an example of what it does:
