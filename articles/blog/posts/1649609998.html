		<p>I've spent the last two hours writing a big fancy python script to replace a couple words in HTML for me. Basically I type the content of the post (meta) into a file called post.txt and then run the script, give it a date and a title and it'll spit out a file called like 0751098475091.html which I then manually copy-paste into index.html because I'm not good enough at programming to figure out how to insert text like that. I might put it on GitHub but <a href="https://poop.uno/blog/postwriter.py">here's a link to it</a> if you're interested.</p>
