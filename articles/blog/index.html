                <p><p>I've started working on a conlang in a notebook during school. I don't have a name for it yet, but I'll come up with something. Its vocabulary is inspired mostly by Polish and what little Spanish I know. I've got a writing system down in which you write consonants (k, v, b, g, etc.) as full characters and vowels (a, i, y, etc.) as diacritics above them. Words end up being mostly CVCVCVCV like in Japanese. As a consequence words cannot begin with vowels, which makes trying to co-opt vocab a fun challenge. Might post it all on GitHub later, idk.</p></p>

                <p>I've spent the last two hours writing a big fancy python script to replace a couple words in HTML for me. Basically I type the content of the post (meta) into a file called post.txt and then run the script, give it a date and a title and it'll spit out a file called like 0751098475091.html which I then manually copy-paste into index.html because I'm not good enough at programming to figure out how to insert text like that. I might put it on GitHub but <a href="https://poop.uno/blog/postwriter.py">here's a link to it</a> if you're interested.</p>

                <p>Writing is so difficult for me, not because I'm not good at coming up with the necessary words but because any form of emotional expression through language is impossible for me. I keep sitting down to write these short stories I have in mind and after two sentences they become too emotionally charged and I just can't bear to even think about it anymore! I don't know if it's some mental illness or just because men are conditioned to be emotionless husks in modern society but it's infuriating to simultaneously hate emotional expression and desperately need to perform it.</p>

                <p>I bought a book called "First Year Polish" off Amazon (hail to Bezos) because my Polish is lacking and I'm going to Poland later this year and I would not like to be a complete bumbling fool.  Turns out there's 7 cases for verbs and 5 genders, which is so much fun and not stupidly difficult. I am of the belief that Polish is not a natural language a twisted mind game handed down to humanity over a thousand years ago by an alien overlord who souhgt to destroy by giving us a language so complex that it would cause to expend so much trying to use we would shrivel up and die. This is why every Polish male is incredibly powerful and able to eat trains, because it is the greatest example of artificial selection at work (hail Bezos!).</p>
