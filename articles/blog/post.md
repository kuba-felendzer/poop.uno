I've started working on a conlang in a notebook during school. I don't have a name for it yet, but I'll come up with something. Its vocabulary is inspired mostly by Polish and what little Spanish I know. I've got a writing system down in which you write consonants (k, v, b, g, etc.) as full characters and vowels (a, i, y, etc.) as diacritics above them. Words end up being mostly CVCVCVCV like in Japanese. As a consequence words cannot begin with vowels, which makes trying to co-opt vocab a fun challenge. Might post it all on GitHub later, idk.
